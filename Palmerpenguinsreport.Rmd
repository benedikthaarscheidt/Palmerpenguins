# Introduction

**Jaesub ver)** In the intricate web of the natural world, the phenomenon of sexual dimorphism stands out as a captivating manifestation of evolutionary diversity. Just like in the species homo sapiens, the animal kingdom showcases a myriad of fascinating adaptations that highlight the distinct physical and behavioral differences between males and females of the same species. Sexual dimorphism, rooted in the forces of natural selection and reproductive strategies, offers a window into the adaptive mechanisms that have shaped countless species over millennia.  

From the majestic mane of a male lion to the vibrant plumage of a male peacock, sexual dimorphism is often prominently displayed in the external characteristics of animals. This manifests as differences in size, coloration, behavior, or reproductive anatomy between the sexes of a species. Beyond mere aesthetics, these differences often serve crucial roles in the survival and reproductive success of individuals within a species. A fundamental understanding of the various forms of sexual dimorphism in a variety of species will be an important step toward understanding the evolutionary pressures that have shaped these unique traits and behaviors.

This report is dedicated to the comprehensive examination of sexual dimorphism in the context of penguins, and highlight the ecological and reproductive significance of these differences. By undertaking this investigation, we endeavor to acquire a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics between males and females within various species, elucidating how evolutionary pressures have contributed to the development of these distinctive relationships.

In Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus), one of the most recognizable and widely studied penguin species, sexual dimorphism manifests notably in aspects such as body mass, flipper length, and bill size. This report aims to explore and quantify the differences between male and female Chinstrap penguins, shedding light on how these disparities play a crucial role in their breeding behavior, survival strategies, and overall ecology.

Chinstrap penguins, known for their distinctive black band under their heads, inhabit several islands and shores in the Southern Pacific and the Antarctic Ocean. These regions' harsh and competitive environments necessitate various adaptations, potentially influencing the development of sexual dimorphism. Previous studies have indicated that differences in body size and features between males and females could be attributed to factors like mating competition, foraging efficiency, and parental roles in nurturing the young.

# Data
The data employed to substantiate the previously posited hypothesis was sourced from the Palmerpenguins package of the CRAN R library. This package encapsulates an extensive dataset named penguins_raw featuring dimensions such as body mass, size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for adult Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program curated and generously shared this dataset, showcasing the collaborative nature of scientific endeavors. Spanning 344 penguins across three distinct species (Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo ), the dataset originates from three islands within the Palmer Archipelago, providing a rich tapestry of geographical diversity. Notably, the dataset includes morphological measurements, with culmen (bill) length and depth thoughtfully renamed as bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm for clarity, contributing to a nuanced comprehension of penguin ecology. Complementing the morphological data are clutch observations shedding light on the reproductive behavior of the penguins and blood isotope ratios offering insights into their dietary habits and foraging strategies. Furthermore the dataset extends to other sample information such as individual ID of the observed penguin, the sample number, the study name and some comments. Since were interested in performing a descriptive analysis and use the information to abstract and generalize, we simply ignore those datapoints and focus on the described relevant ones.

In the pursuit of substantiating the stated hypothesis, our focus is on comparing key characteristics such as bill/culmen length and depth, body mass, delta 13C, delta 15N, and flipper size between male and female penguins. The objective is to discern potential sexual dimorphism and its implications in the context of the penguin species under study. Moreover, we intend to extend our analysis by comparing the obtained results with a dataset concerning possums in Australia and potentially other species. This comparative approach aims to abstract the underlying hypothesis and draw inferences that transcend the confines of the penguin dataset, contributing to a broader understanding of sexual dimorphism and ecological dynamics across diverse species. In our exploration of the palmerpenguins dataset, we focused on pertinent dimensions to substantiate our hypothesis, selectively disregarding columns not integral to our investigation.

# Statistical analysis

To extract crucial insights from the penguins dataset and pursue our primary objective, which is to emphasize our hypothesis that there are distinctive physical characteristics between male and female penguins, we employ built-in R utilities and leverage specific functionalities offered by the "effsize" package accessible through the CRAN repository. All computations and tests are executed within the R Markdown environment. This approach allows us to thoroughly analyze the dataset, assess sex-based variations, and validate our underlying hypothesis with a comprehensive set of statistical tools.

To accomplish this, certain key steps must be taken:
The dataset needs preparation, requiring a split into the two sexes to facilitate individual comparisons.

Distribution of sexes within the dataset:
```{r}
knitr::kable(table(df$Sex,df$Species))
chinstrapset=df[df$Species =="Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)",]
```


Next, we calculate various statistical parameters without relying on specific tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These parameters, including the standard deviation of bill length and depth, body mass, and flipper length, along with the mean, median, and a comprehensive summary, will be interpreted in the results section:

## Mean Chinstrap population
```{r}
meanbodymasschinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Body Mass (g)", na.rm=TRUE)
meanbilllengthchinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Culmen Length (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
meanbilldepthchinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Culmen Depth (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
meanflipperlengthchinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Flipper Length (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Median Chinstrap population
```{r}
medianbodymasschinstrap=median(chinstrapset$"Body Mass (g)", na.rm=TRUE)
medianbilllengthchinstrap=median(chinstrapset$"Culmen Length (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
medianbilldepthchinstrap=median(chinstrapset$"Culmen Depth (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
medianflipperlengthchinstrap=median(chinstrapset$"Flipper Length (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Subsetting Chinstrap penguin set by sexes
```{r}

chinstrapmale=chinstrapset[chinstrapset$Sex =="MALE",]
chinstrapfemale=chinstrapset[chinstrapset$Sex =="FEMALE",]

#Summary of all the columns of the individual subsets 
summarychinstrapfemale=summary(chinstrapfemale[,3:6])
summarychinstrapmale=summary(chinstrapmale[,3:6])

meanbodymasschinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Body Mass (g)", na.rm=TRUE)
meanbilllengthchinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Culmen Length (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
meanbilldepthchinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Culmen Depth (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
meanflipperlengthchinstrap=mean(chinstrapset$"Flipper Length (mm)", na.rm=TRUE)
```


Furthermore without relying on specific statistical test like the Kolmogorov Smirnov test or the like, basic statistical parameters were calculated which will be interpreted in the results section. Those are the standard deviation of bill length and depth, the bodymass and the flipper length, the mean of all those physical traits, the median of those traits, as well as a concluding summary of those traits:
